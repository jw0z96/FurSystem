alin's feedback:

so in terms of what would be cool as feature
to not have separate draw curves nodes but only one output node
which will draw the particles
I mean hair
and then add some sort of mix nodes

to mix say curve distributors

then, a noise like you said which can be used for lengths or distribution or whatever else

yea
cus I was experimenting with normal length hair and then another generator thingy for longer less dense hair
so if I could combine that result into one which I can render it out
instead of having 2 or 3 different rendering nodes

also clumping works cool I think

length variation would be good and noise on the actual shape of the strand
and different features maybe a gravity puller
or brushes to comb it
but thats really later on I guess

for the interface I have more notes:
overall it is quite intuitive, quite easy to pick up
just a few things which would make things easier
1. naming the node the same as in the node browser
cus it tends to be confusing otherwise
2. if you could also pop the browser with Tab
3. pan in 2d mode with middle mouse button instead of left mouse button
4. select stuff with left mouse button
